# Data Assimilation of the COVID-19 pandemic using an augmented SIR model

Periodical update of [assimilated
COVID-19-Data](https://www.zenodo.org/record/3738945) based on the
[Johns-Hopkins-University
database](https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19.git) and data
from the [Robert-Koch
Institut](https://www.rki.de/DE/Content/InfAZ/N/Neuartiges_Coronavirus/Fallzahlen.html).
The source of the code used for the data assimilation, which may be used unlimitedly for non-commercial purposes, can be found [here](https://github.com/sesterhenn/Corona.jl).

## Model
For the purpose of the data assimilation, the _Susceptible-Infectious-Recovered-Deceased_ ([SIRD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compartmental_models_in_epidemiology#The_SIRD_model)) model is used.

## Legend
* Confirmed Cases and Deaths from the JHU or RKI. 
* Solid lines are assimilated results.  
* The growth rate ![A_{22}](https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=A_%7B22%7D) is given by ![\partial f_2/\partial I](https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=%5Cpartial%20f_2%2F%5Cpartial%20I), where ![f_2=\partial_t I= \beta I S / N - \gamma I - \mu I](https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=f_2%3D%5Cpartial_t%20I%3D%20%5Cbeta%20I%20S%20%2F%20N%20-%20%5Cgamma%20I%20-%20%5Cmu%20I).

## Results
An updated overview of the assimilation is shown in the following. The complete results can be visualized by clicking on _full report_. The numerical values are available in the [results](results) folder as CSV files.
